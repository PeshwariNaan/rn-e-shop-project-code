*** Here are the instructions and links to relative information such as npm packages to download to build this app***
Using latest Node LTS version - 16.13.0 - make switching node versions easy with nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
Add all folders and initial files to start: screens, components, navigation, fonts(in the assets folder if needed), store with actions and reducers folders etc...
Install npm redux and react-redux - I used npm as opposed to yarn in this project.
Install react navigation: npm install @react-navigation/native - this is V6
Follow react nav 6x documentation https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/ - there are a couple of breaking changes if moving from 5x
See package.json if having trouble with dependencies and check versions - it can be finicky.
