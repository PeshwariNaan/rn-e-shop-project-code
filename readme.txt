*** Here are the instructions and links to relative information such as npm packages to download to build this app***
Using latest Node LTS version - 16.13.0 - make switching node versions easy with nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
Add all folders and initial files to start: screens, components, navigation, fonts(in the assets folder if needed), store with actions and reducers folders etc...
Install npm redux and react-redux - I used npm as opposed to yarn in this project.
Install react navigation: npm install @react-navigation/native - this is V6
Also expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context to run with navigation 6x
Install react-navigation-header-buttons
